# Certificate Generator - Changes Summary

## ✅ What I Did

### Frontend Updates

1. **Created API Integration** (`frontend/api/upload.ts`)
   - Functions to upload CSV and PDF files to `http://localhost:3001/api`
   - No more localStorage - all files go to the backend

2. **Updated Upload Page** (`frontend/app/upload/page.tsx`)
   - Files are sent to backend when dropped
   - Shows uploading state
   - Stores filenames in sessionStorage after successful upload
   - Removed localStorage usage completely

3. **Updated Certificate Page** (`frontend/app/certificate/page.tsx`)
   - Reads filenames from sessionStorage
   - Ready to use those filenames for certificate generation

### Backend Updates

1. **Created Upload Route** (`backend/routes/upload.js`)
   - Handles CSV uploads at `/api/upload/csv`
   - Handles PDF uploads at `/api/upload/certificate`
   - Saves files to `backend/uploads/` with timestamps

2. **Updated Main App** (`backend/app.js`)
   - Added CORS support
   - Added upload routes

3. **Updated Dependencies** (`backend/package.json`)
   - Added `cors` and `multer` packages

## 🚀 What You Need To Do

### 1. Install Backend Packages
```bash
cd backend
npm install
```

### 2. Start Backend Server
```bash
npm start
```

Server should run on port 3001.

### 3. Start Frontend (if not running)
```bash
cd frontend
npm run dev
```

## 📁 File Flow

1. User drops CSV → `POST localhost:3001/api/upload/csv` → Saved to `backend/uploads/`
2. User drops PDF → `POST localhost:3001/api/upload/certificate` → Saved to `backend/uploads/`
3. User clicks Continue → Filenames stored in sessionStorage → Next page reads them
